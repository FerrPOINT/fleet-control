# Java Agent Adapter Contract

Java Agent is modeled alongside Hermes. Existing local jar provisioning layout,
start/stop/restart and readiness checks are implemented and retained. Chat/control,
configuration activation and automatic SDLC admission remain phase 2.

Current launch: `java -jar agentN/runtime/backend.jar --spring.profiles.active=noop`.
The jar is supplied externally; a missing jar is a validation error. Readiness
uses `/actuator/health/readiness` with the Java service's db-only readiness contract.

Expected launch inputs:

- `AGENT_SERVER_PORT`
- `SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL_LOCATION`
- workspace cwd

Expected endpoints:

- `GET /actuator/health/readiness` (current lifecycle)
- `POST /api/v1/agent/chat/stream`
- `GET/POST /api/v2/sessions`
- `GET /v1/capabilities`

Unimplemented chat/control/stream/approval operations return typed
`not_implemented`. The generic phase-2 label must not disable the working jar
lifecycle. Java is not ready for automatic SDLC until required capabilities and
workflow bindings have been verified.

## Configuration Foundation Candidate

Pinned Base role-package preparation is Hermes-only. Java Agent configuration
activation retains its existing phase-2 refusal; this packet does not add a Java
installer, alternate admission path or runtime-readiness claim.
