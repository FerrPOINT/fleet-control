# Chat Clarification Verification

Date: 2026-10-01. Status: verified foundation, incomplete approved vertical slice.
No real PM publication/resume or live Backlog acceptance is claimed.

## Source Baseline

Fleet foundation: `470f2856735bde5eff5bc969b6973a6d38044b12`.
Tracker implementation: `24f0f1e` (includes `0cffd7d8` clarification foundation).
Workflow implementation: `a99a5d8`.
Existing unrelated sibling workspaces were not changed. Each service has its own branch.

## Verified Fleet Gates

- Linux Rust 1.88: format, all-target check, strict Clippy, workspace tests and source
  OpenAPI regeneration/diff. 69 library tests; 11 actual PostgreSQL foundation cases.
- Isolated PostgreSQL 17.6: clean ten-migration up, central-subject regression with its
  own configured database URL, migration 000010 down/reapply/status.
- Frontend: generated API drift, seven Tracker wire-contract comparisons, checker tests,
  typecheck, production build, lint and format; 146 unit tests passed.
- Playwright: 21 fixtures passed in Chromium/Firefox/WebKit. PM tabs have no document-level
  overflow at 375x812, 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, no serious/critical scoped axe violations,
  tablet Escape/focus restoration and keyboard tab navigation. Nine generated controller
  images have verified routes/viewports/content hashes; liveAcceptance is explicitly false.
- Controller browser evidence is fixture-only. The real chat component uses fixed-origin
  gateway clients; mocked APIs in the browser test do not dispatch Hermes or resume Workflow.

The library/workspace gate and targeted PostgreSQL cases are separate evidence. Tests with
an absent database variable must not be described as database acceptance. Native Windows
Rust linker availability and remote CI head status remain separate gates.

## Cross-Service Evidence

Tracker's own verification ledger records strict central/project/owner/machine authorization,
durable questions/answers/revisions/confirmations/outbox and a real PostgreSQL HTTP test
with a synthetic Central Auth issuer. Its follow-up adds restart-safe human Draft creation,
with project access rechecked on replay, and passes strict Clippy after six minimal
pre-existing warning fixes. It does not dispatch PM. Draft verification is independent
of live cross-service PM acceptance.

Workflow's own ledger records 1,932 unit and 52 PostgreSQL tests, focused PM contract tests,
Ruff/mypy and generated OpenAPI checks. Its continuation API consumes a trusted Fleet probe;
Fleet now implements the callback server. The dispatch/resume orchestrator is still pending.

## PM Readback Follow-Up

### Targeted Runtime Approval Follow-Up

The working branch implements a generated exact-request API, human-session-only
decisions, immutable command reservation before HTTP, audited single-request
resolution and durable invalidation. Broad legacy approval calls fail closed.
Approval requested/responded events are no longer treated as interchangeable.

Additional actual PostgreSQL 16 integration cases passed: concurrent replay,
foreign-owner denial, changed command conflict, secret redaction, single-request
resolution and immutable decision audits; authenticated fake-Hermes HTTP proves
machine denial, malformed acknowledgement remaining uncertain, safe readback and
no duplicate dispatch. A deterministic lock-order regression covers concurrent
delivery/replay and actor foreign-key locks. Signed provider JWTs through the actual
authentication middleware do not prove a human approval session, including invented
session claims. Historical readback/replay survives PM reassignment without dispatch,
but fresh commands fail stale fencing and revoked project access denies all reads.
This is not live Hermes/provider acceptance. Integrated approval UI passes unit tests
and Chromium/Firefox/WebKit fixtures; independent reconciliation of an unknown runtime
decision remains open.

The production ingester accepts Hermes `approval.request` and compatible
`approval.requested`, never `approval.responded` as a new request. Its separate own-PG
authenticated fake-Hermes SSE test proves two exact request IDs, replay/concurrent
upserts and no response-created request rows. CI explicitly runs this ignored test
and directory acceptance on separate PostgreSQL 17 databases.

The directory sidecar passed its separate own-database acceptance and one-query
scoped aggregation checks, all frontend gates (160 unit tests), and Chromium,
Firefox and WebKit fixture flows. Light/dark viewport captures are fixture evidence;
they do not substitute for live acceptance or the final production manifest.

The working branch extends its single pending migration 000010 with an atomic immutable PM run reservation,
write-once acknowledgement mapping and fresh Hermes readback for Workflow. The
callback uses a dedicated machine credential and is not browser-authenticated.
Terminal proof cannot regress; an unknown reservation retains agent capacity.
Hermes alias resolution is supported by pinning the acknowledged effective
runtime session ID separately from Fleet's stable session identity.

WSL workspace tests passed with 88 library tests and 19 actual PostgreSQL cases
(18 SDLC foundation cases plus managed settings). These follow-up database tests
used PostgreSQL 16.15 because the shared Docker engine was unresponsive. They do
not replace the required PostgreSQL 17 migration/CI gate. The new cases exercise
actual PostgreSQL transactions and the Fleet callback against an authenticated
test HTTP runtime, not a real Hermes PM/provider. The directory test is explicitly
ignored in the normal workspace suite and needs its own disposable database.

The clean disposable PostgreSQL 16 database passed ten-migration up, pending
000010 down/reapply/status before merging the refreshed main branch. Main has an
additional accepted product-deployment migration; the final merged tree will contain
eleven files but only one new migration in this feature PR. It requires fresh final
verification. Previous unconsolidated eleven-file QA runs are not evidence for that
tree. No accepted runtime database or volume was changed. Production rollback must
disable the feature rather than remove run proof.

The PM tests cover concurrent identical reservations, payload conflict, immutable
mapping/fence/terminal proof, unknown acceptance holding capacity, bad callback
credential, wrong Hermes run/session identity, fresh observation IDs and runtime
unavailability after terminal proof. Real provider, structured PM tools and
checkpoint/resume acceptance remain separate requirements.

The accepted snapshot [tracker-clarification-v1.json](contracts/tracker-clarification-v1.json)
was generated from the Tracker commit above, not authored as an independent API spec.
The checker resolves schema refs and compares fields/requiredness/types/nullability/formats/
enums. Constraints and business permissions are checked by service tests, not by that wire
normalizer. Rollout must compare the actual Tracker build with the same snapshot.

## Release Blockers

Creation saga, scoped PM structured tools, Tracker outbox/Fleet inbox projection, live
Hermes PM verification and workflow resume/rebind, independent readiness verifier,
live directory and restart/denial
acceptance remain open in [GAP_REGISTER](GAP_REGISTER.md).

Task-bound ordinary prompts and steer are intentionally rejected. The answer receipt means
Tracker saved an answer, not PM received it. No deployment switch, merge or production-ready
claim should bypass these gaps. Fixture images remain outside the live screenshot manifest.
